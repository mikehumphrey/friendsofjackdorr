A boy from Ashland, Oregon, Jack was diagnosed with an aggressive Astrocytoma brain tumor on his spine in January of 2013 at the age of 8 years old. Shortly thereafter Jack had some of the tumor resected and started treatment that included radiation and chemotherapy. Through all that he endured in treatment and the side effects of his disease, Jack remained an active, playful and happy boy. Sadly Jack's condition worsened in April of 2014 as his brain tumor progressed. He slowly lost the use of his legs and his hands as the cancer took over. The community of Ashland, Oregon and the surrounding area showed tremendous love and support for Jack and his family.

Jack passed away at the age of 10 on May 16, 2014, wrapped in the loving arms of his mother Trish. We will always remember the boy with the beautiful eyes, incredible smile, and loving heart. We love you Jack.
