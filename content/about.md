Friends of Jack Dorr is a non-profit organization established in 2019 to preserve the memory of Jack Dorr by various means. Some of these include:

* Supporting Pediatric Brain Tumor Research at OHSU’s Doernbecher Children’s Hospital. This is where Jack received treatment and loving and compassionate care.
  * When Jack Dorr battled an aggressive brain tumor, the treatment he received at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, OR, gave him and his family what they needed...time. “I feel very strongly that the work Doernbecher did (surgery, radiation, oncology) gave us many extra months with Jack, as I think he probably would have died almost a year sooner than he did,” said his mother, Trish. “Jack may never have had a chance at recovery, but they bought us time, and that year was one of the most important in my life.”
* Supporting children and their families who are affected by Pediatric Cancer.
* Contributing to children’s libraries such as the one at Helman Elementary, where Jack was a student. He was an avid reader and spent hours with a book in his lap!
