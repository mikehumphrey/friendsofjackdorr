# Supporting Children with Cancer

When Jack Dorr battled an aggressive brain tumor, the treatment he received at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, OR, gave him and his family what they needed…time. “I feel very strongly that the work Doernbecher did (surgery, radiation, oncology) gave us many extra months with Jack, as I think he probably would have died almost a year sooner than he did,” said his mother, Trish. “Jack may never have had a chance at recovery, but they bought us time, and that year was one of the most important in my life.” By donating to the Friends of Jack Dorr you can help support more families like the Dorrs. 

Proceeds will go to Doernbecher’s Pediatric Brain Tumor Research Program.
