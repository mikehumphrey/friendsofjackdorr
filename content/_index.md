Friends of Jack Dorr is a non-profit organization established in 2019 to preserve the memory of Jack Dorr, a boy from Ashland, OR who passed away after battling an aggressive brain tumor in 2014. He received treatment at OHSU’s Doernbecher Chidren’s Hospital, where neurosurgeons, neurooncologists and radiologists worked as a team to provide the best care and quality of life that they could given his diagnosis.

This organization serves to support the research of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Research Team, as only 4% of funds raised by the American Cancer Society go toward pediatric cancer research. We feel compelled to augment the important work they do and the research that could save a child’s life or give them and their family more time together.

In addition to the Research Team, we have also provided funds for the Dorr Family Library at Helman, a place that Jack loved to spend time. He was an avid reader and passed any an hour following the adventures of Frodo or Harry Potter, immersing himself in everything from Redwall to Calvin and Hobbes.

In order to honor Jack’s lively and playful spirit, we have hosted dodgeball tournaments in February, near the date of his Valentine’s Day birthday. This year, our event will take place on Sunday, May 15 at Ashland High School. We work together with the Ashland High School leadership team, several sponsors and donors and community members to bring people together in the spirit of community and playful competition. In previous years, we had the Ashland Fire Department form two teams along with 20+ other teams to raise money and play together!

Our 2022 fundraising goal is $5,000. Please consider joining us as for our 2022 event!
